## Engineering Focus

I design and ship production-grade systems where scale, latency, and failure modes are real constraints not hypotheticals. My work spans distributed systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and high-throughput data pipelines, with an emphasis on solutions that remain stable under production pressure.

### Selected Impact
- Designed event-driven pipelines processing **50K+ events per second** with **sub-500ms end-to-end latency**.
- Improved production database performance through indexing and query optimization, reducing **API response times by ~30%**.
- Built and deployed AWS-based microservices and ML platforms supporting **50+ enterprise clients**.
- Authored peer-reviewed research in **distributed systems and blockchain consensus**, connecting theory with practical system design.

### Background
- Master’s candidate in Computer Science, Northeastern University (Boston, MA)
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect
- 1.5+ years shipping enterprise-grade software
- Open to backend, infrastructure, and distributed systems roles
